There are two different chassis options: 3DP (3D Printed) and WOOD (3mm Plywood). We reccomend using the wood option, it uses LED strips which are easier to solder and broadly works more consistently. 

Cut Chassis.dxf out of 3mm plywood or any other 3mm material. PaperCover.dxf can be cut out of thin, flexible as a cover for the reflective white areas of the LED strips. We used matte black construction paper. The wiring information can be found on page 56 of FireFly_Technical_Report.pdf
